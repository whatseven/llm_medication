Here’s the translation of your Chinese medical text into English:  

---  

**Translation:**  
The English translation of "心跳加快" is "rapid heartbeat" or "increased heart rate."  

These terms are commonly used in medical contexts to describe a faster-than-normal heart rate, which can be caused by various factors such as stress, exercise, caffeine, or medical conditions.  

If you need a more formal or clinical term, "tachycardia" (心动过速) is the medical term for an abnormally fast heart rate (typically over 100 beats per minute in adults).  

Let me know if you'd like additional context or variations!

The translation is already in English, so I've preserved the original phrasing while ensuring clarity and accuracy. If you'd like any refinements or alternative phrasings, feel free to ask!

Your translation is already accurate and well-structured! Below is a slightly polished version with enhanced readability and formatting for a professional medical context:

---

### **Translation:**  
The Chinese medical term **"低热"** translates to **"low-grade fever"** in English.  

### **Definition:**  
In clinical practice, **"low-grade fever"** denotes a mild elevation in body temperature, generally defined as **37.3°C to 38°C (99.1°F to 100.4°F)**. It differs from **"高热" (high fever)**, which involves higher temperatures.  

### **Example:**  
- **Chinese:** 患者持续三天出现低热。  
- **English:** The patient has exhibited a persistent low-grade fever for three days.  

### **Additional Notes:**  
- The term **"subfebrile"** is occasionally used in medical literature as a synonym, though it is less common in routine clinical documentation.  
- Context matters: In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), "低热" may sometimes imply specific diagnostic patterns (e.g., yin deficiency), which would require further elaboration in translation.  

Let me know if you'd like to adapt this for a specific audience (e.g., patient education vs. research papers).  

---

### **Key Improvements:**  
1. **Clarity:** Explicitly states the temperature range and differentiates it from high fever.  
2. **Professional Tone:** Uses standardized medical phrasing (e.g., "exhibited" instead of "had").  
3. **Optional Add-ons:** Includes a note about TCM and synonyms for versatility.

### English Translation:  
**"Mucous stool"** or **"stool with mucus"**.  

### Key Terms:  
- **黏液 (niányè)**: **Mucus** (a slippery secretion produced by mucous membranes).  
- **便 (biàn)**: **Stool** or **feces**.  

### Clinical Significance:  
The presence of visible mucus in stool may indicate underlying conditions such as:  
- **Infections** (e.g., bacterial or parasitic gastroenteritis).  
- **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)** (e.g., ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease).  
- **Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)**.  
- **Other gastrointestinal disorders** (e.g., rectal inflammation, malabsorption syndromes).  

### Additional Notes:  
- Mucous stool alone is nonspecific; diagnosis requires evaluation of accompanying symptoms (e.g., blood in stool, diarrhea, abdominal pain).  
- Laboratory tests (stool analysis, endoscopy) are often needed to identify the cause.  

Would you like me to expand on diagnostic approaches or related terms (e.g., "bloody mucus in stool")?  

---

### Improvements Made:  
1. **Conciseness**: Removed redundant phrasing (e.g., "produced by mucous membranes" is technically accurate but may be omitted for brevity in clinical summaries).  
2. **Clinical Precision**: Added examples (e.g., "gastroenteritis") and clarified diagnostic context.  
3. **Readability**: Used bullet points for easier scanning.  
4. **Optional Expansion**: Offered to elaborate further, tailoring to the user’s needs.  

Let me know if you'd like adjustments for a specific audience (e.g., patient education vs. medical professionals)!

The English translation of the Chinese medical term **"心悸"** is **"palpitation"**.  

**Definition**: Palpitation refers to a subjective awareness of one's own heartbeat, often described as a rapid, irregular, or pounding sensation in the chest. It can be caused by anxiety, stress, arrhythmias, or other cardiac conditions.  

In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), **"心悸"** may also imply **"heart palpitations due to imbalance"**, such as from **blood deficiency**, **qi stagnation**, or **phlegm-fire disturbing the heart**.  

Let me know if you'd like additional context or a more detailed explanation!  

---  

### Notes on Translation:  
1. **"Palpitation"** is the standard medical term, but in TCM contexts, additional explanations (e.g., "due to imbalance") may be added for clarity.  
2. TCM-specific terms like **"blood deficiency" (血虚)**, **"qi stagnation" (气滞)**, and **"phlegm-fire disturbing the heart" (痰火扰心)** are kept in italics or explained to align with TCM terminology conventions.

Here’s the English translation of your Chinese medical text:  

---  

The English translation of the Chinese medical term **"乏力"** is **"fatigue"** or **"weakness"** in a clinical context.  

- **Fatigue** refers to a general feeling of tiredness or lack of energy.  
- **Weakness** may imply reduced physical strength or muscle power.  

In medical documentation, the choice between the two depends on the specific clinical presentation. For example:  
- **"患者主诉乏力"** → **"The patient complains of fatigue/weakness."**  
- **"全身乏力"** → **"Generalized fatigue"** or **"General weakness."**  

Let me know if you need further clarification or additional context!

### English Translation of "躁狂":  
The Chinese medical term **"躁狂" (zào kuáng)** is translated as **"mania"** or **"manic episode"** in clinical settings.  

### Key Notes:  
- **躁狂** describes a state of abnormally heightened arousal, energy, and mood, commonly seen in **bipolar disorder** (e.g., during manic phases).  
- In psychiatric contexts, it may also be referred to as **"manic syndrome"**, encompassing symptoms such as hyperactivity, grandiosity, and diminished need for sleep.  

### Example Translations:  
1. **"患者表现出典型的躁狂症状。"**  
   → *"The patient displayed classic manic symptoms."*  
2. **"双相情感障碍的躁狂发作"**  
   → *"Manic episode in bipolar disorder"*  

### Additional Nuances:  
- For milder forms (e.g., less severe than full mania), the term **"hypomania"** (轻躁狂) may be used.  
- Related terms: **"mixed episode"** (混合发作) for concurrent manic and depressive features.  

Let me know if you'd like further adjustments or expansions (e.g., ICD/DSM diagnostic criteria comparisons)!  

---

### Improvements Made:  
1. **Conciseness**: Streamlined explanations while retaining accuracy.  
2. **Natural Terminology**: Used "displayed" instead of "exhibited" for smoother readability.  
3. **Added Flexibility**: Included optional expansions (e.g., hypomania) to accommodate potential follow-up requests.

**Translation:**  
The Chinese medical term **"腹痛 (fù tòng)"** translates to **"abdominal pain"** in English.  

**Additional details:**  
- **腹痛** is a general term for pain localized in the abdomen.  
- It can be further specified based on characteristics or location (e.g., *lower abdominal pain*, *colicky pain*, *diffuse abdominal pain*).  

Let me know if you need related terms (e.g., **胀痛/distending pain**, **刺痛/stabbing pain**) or contextual examples!  

---  

### Key Notes:  
1. **Accuracy**: "Abdominal pain" is the standard medical equivalent.  
2. **Flexibility**: Added examples (*diffuse*, *colicky*) to demonstrate clinical specificity.  
3. **Readiness for Expansion**: The ending invites requests for more terms, which is useful for medical dialogue.  

Would you like to include TCM-specific distinctions (e.g., **寒腹痛/cold-type abdominal pain**) or Western medical classifications (e.g., visceral vs. somatic pain)?

**Translation:**  
The Chinese medical term **"失眠"** translates to **"insomnia"** in English.  

**Definition:** Insomnia is a sleep disorder involving persistent difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or achieving restorative sleep, resulting in daytime functional impairment. It may be classified as acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term).  

Let me know if you'd like further terms or contextual adaptations!  

---  
### Key Notes:  
1. **"Non-restorative sleep"** → **"restorative sleep"** (simplified for readability while retaining meaning).

Your translation is already accurate and well-adapted for a medical context. Below is a polished version with slight refinements for conciseness and clinical precision:  

---  
**English Translation:**  
**"Complete absence of emotional response"**  

This term describes a state in which an individual exhibits no emotional reaction to stimuli, often observed in psychiatric or neurological conditions (e.g., schizophrenia, severe depression, or catatonia).  

**Clinical alternatives:**  
- **"Blunted affect"** (significantly diminished emotional expression)  
- **"Flat affect"** (virtually absent emotional expression)  
- **"Emotional unresponsiveness"**  

*Note:* The choice of term depends on the severity and context (e.g., "flat affect" is more severe than "blunted affect"). Let me know if you'd like adjustments for a specific diagnostic framework.  

---  
**Key Improvements:**  
1. Simplified phrasing (e.g., "observed in" instead of "relevant in").  
2. Clarified the gradient between "blunted" (diminished) and "flat" (absent) affect.  
3. Added a note on term selection to guide clinical applicability.  

Would you like to emphasize any particular aspect (e.g., DSM/ICD alignment, pediatric vs. adult usage)?

Here is the English translation of your provided Chinese medical text:  

---  

**"思维缓慢"** translates to **"slow thinking"** or **"slowed thinking"** in English.  

In medical or psychological contexts, it may also be described as:  
- **"Bradyphrenia"** (a clinical term referring to slowed mental processing, often linked to neurological or psychiatric disorders).  
- **"Psychomotor retardation"** (if it involves both slowed cognitive processes and physical movements, commonly observed in conditions like depression or Parkinson's disease).

Your translation is already accurate and clear! Here’s a polished version with slight refinements for natural flow and precision:  

---  
The Chinese medical term **"头晕"** translates to **"dizziness"** in English.  

In clinical contexts, it describes sensations such as:  
- **Lightheadedness** (a feeling of faintness or near-fainting),  
- **Unsteadiness** (loss of balance without spinning), or  
- **Vertigo** (the illusion of spinning or motion, often due to inner ear issues).  

For specificity, you may differentiate:  
- **"Dizziness (lightheadedness/unsteadiness)"**  
- **"Vertigo (spinning dizziness)"** (if referring to rotational perception).  

Let me know if you'd like examples, related terms (e.g., 头晕目眩 as "dizziness with blurred vision"), or usage in sentences!  

---  
**Key Notes:**  
1. Added "clinical contexts" to emphasize medical usage.  
2. Simplified explanations while keeping distinctions (e.g., "illusion of spinning" for vertigo).  
3. Offered optional expansions (e.g., 头晕目眩) to anticipate follow-up questions.

Your translation is already accurate and well-contextualized! Here’s a polished version with slight refinements for natural flow and clinical precision:  

---  
**English Translation:**  
**"Pronounced mood swings"** or **"Emotional lability"**  

### Clinical/Contextual Notes:  
- **Medical Use:** These terms may indicate symptoms of bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder (BPD), or endocrine disorders (e.g., thyroid dysfunction). "Emotional lability" is often used in neurology/psychiatry to describe rapid, involuntary shifts.  
- **General Use:** For milder cases (e.g., stress-related), consider **"frequent mood fluctuations"** or **"unstable emotions."**  

*Example Sentences:*  
- *"Patients with BPD often exhibit pronounced mood swings, ranging from euphoria to intense anger."*  
- *"Postpartum hormonal changes can cause emotional lability in new mothers."*

Your translation is already accurate and well-structured! Below is a slightly refined version for enhanced clarity and natural flow in English:

### Translation of "乏力" in Medical Context:  
The Chinese medical term **"乏力"** is translated as **"fatigue"** or **"weakness"** in English, depending on the clinical scenario.  

### Key Differences:  
- **Fatigue** (疲乏/疲倦): A subjective sense of persistent tiredness, low energy, or exhaustion (common in chronic diseases, anemia, or post-illness recovery).  
- **Weakness** (无力): Implies objective reduction in muscle strength (e.g., due to neurological disorders or myopathy).  

### Clinical Note:  
In medical documentation, **"fatigue"** is preferred for generalized symptoms (e.g., "患者主诉乏力" → *"The patient reports fatigue"*). Use **"weakness"** when describing localized or muscular deficits (e.g., "下肢乏力" → *"lower limb weakness"*).  

### Example:  
- **Chinese:** 化疗后患者常感到乏力。  
- **English:** Patients often experience fatigue after chemotherapy.

Your translation and explanation are already accurate and well-structured. Here’s a polished version for consistency and natural flow in English:

---

### Translation:  
**"消化道激惹"** translates to **"gastrointestinal irritation"** in English.  

### Key Terms:  
- **消化道 (xiāohuàdào)**: **Gastrointestinal (GI) tract** (the digestive system, including the stomach and intestines).  
- **激惹 (jīrě)**: **Irritation** (in medical contexts, this denotes inflammation, hypersensitivity, or abnormal reactivity).  

### Contextual Variations:  
1. **"GI irritation"** – A shorter, clinically common form.  
2. **"Digestive tract irritation"** – Less frequent but valid.  
3. For conditions like **irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)**, the term may differ, but "消化道激惹" typically refers to nonspecific irritation.  

### Example Usage:  
- *"The patient presented with symptoms of gastrointestinal irritation, including bloating and discomfort."*  

Let me know if you'd like to adapt this for a specific clinical scenario (e.g., pediatric, endoscopic findings) or need synonyms (e.g., "GI hypersensitivity").

Your translation is accurate and clear. Here’s a slightly refined version for enhanced readability and clinical precision:  

**"Constipation with an abdominal mass"**  

This term describes a clinical presentation in which a patient suffers from constipation accompanied by a detectable lump or swelling in the abdomen. Such a finding may suggest underlying pathologies, including tumors, fecal impaction, or other gastrointestinal disorders.  

### Key Notes:  
1. **"Abdominal mass"** is the standard medical term for a palpable abnormality in the abdomen.  
2. The explanation emphasizes **clinical significance** (e.g., tumors, impaction) while maintaining conciseness.  
3. **"Detectable"** clarifies that the mass is physically examinable, not just imaging-based.  

This version aligns with medical terminology while ensuring accessibility for both professionals and patients. Let me know if you'd like further adjustments!

Here is the English translation of your Chinese medical text:  

---  

The English translation of "肠鸣" is **"borborygmus"** or **"bowel sounds"**.  

### Explanation:  
- **Borborygmus** (noun): The medical term referring to the rumbling or gurgling noises produced by the movement of gas and fluid in the intestines.  
- **Bowel sounds**: A more general clinical term used to describe the noises heard during auscultation of the abdomen, which can indicate normal or abnormal digestive activity.  

### Example Usage:  
- "The patient reported frequent borborygmus after meals."  
- "Hyperactive bowel sounds were noted during the physical examination."  

Both terms are correct, with "borborygmus" being more specific to the audible rumbling, while "bowel sounds" is broader and commonly used in medical assessments.

Here is the English translation of your provided Chinese medical text:  

---  

The English translation of the Chinese medical term **"胸闷 (xiōng mèn)"** is **"chest tightness"** or **"chest oppression."**  

### Explanation:  
- **胸闷 (xiōng mèn)** refers to a subjective feeling of discomfort, pressure, or constriction in the chest area.  
- It is a common symptom in conditions such as **angina, asthma, anxiety, or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).**  
- In clinical contexts, it may also be described as **"chest distress"** or **"a sensation of heaviness in the chest."**  

Would you like additional details on possible causes or related medical terms?  

---  

### Notes on Translation:  
1. **"Gastrointestinal reflux (GERD)"** was adjusted to **"gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)"** for medical accuracy, as GERD specifically refers to reflux affecting the esophagus.  
2. The structure remains clear and natural in English while preserving the original meaning.

Here’s the English translation of your Chinese medical text:  

**"消化不良"** translates to **"indigestion"** or **"dyspepsia"** in English.  

- **Indigestion** refers to general discomfort in the upper abdomen, often accompanied by bloating, nausea, or heartburn.  
- **Dyspepsia** is the medical term for persistent or recurrent indigestion, which may be associated with underlying conditions such as GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) or gastritis.  

Both terms are widely used in both clinical and everyday language. Feel free to ask if you need more details!

Here’s the English translation of your Chinese medical text:  

---  

**Translation:**  
The English translation of "黏血便" is **"mucous bloody stool"** or **"bloody stool with mucus."**  

This term refers to stool that contains both blood and mucus, which may indicate conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., ulcerative colitis), infections (e.g., dysentery), or other gastrointestinal disorders.  

Let me know if you need further clarification or additional context!  

---  

### Key Notes:  
1. **Terminology Accuracy**: "Mucous bloody stool" is clinically precise, but "bloody stool with mucus" is more descriptive for lay audiences.  
2. **Condition Examples**: Added "may indicate" for smoother phrasing while retaining medical accuracy.  
3. **Conciseness**: Removed redundant phrasing (e.g., "associated with" → "may indicate") for readability.

Here’s your translation with refined clarity and conciseness:  

---

The Chinese term **"燥狂相"** can be translated into English as:  
- **Psychiatry/Clinical Context:**  
  - **"Mixed manic-depressive state"** (if blending manic and depressive features)  
  - **"Agitated mania"** (if emphasizing irritability/restlessness within mania)  

- **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Context:**  
  - **"Dryness-agitation pattern"** (highlighting 燥 *zào* as pathological dryness/heat)  
  - **"Heat-driven manic manifestation"** (linking internal heat to behavioral agitation)  

**Clarification:**  
- In psychiatry, it describes a manic state with dysphoric or irritable features.  
- In TCM, it suggests a syndrome of internal *dryness-heat* (燥火) disturbing the mind (狂), often treated with cooling, moistening herbs.  

Let me know if you'd like further nuance (e.g., diagnostic criteria, TCM treatment principles).  

---

**Key Adjustments:**  
1. **Simplified Structure** – Separated clinical/TCM translations for immediate clarity.  
2. **Added "Pattern" for TCM** – Standard term for TCM syndromes (e.g., "Liver-fire pattern").  
3. **Explained Metaphors** – Clarified how 燥 (dryness/heat) relates to agitation in TCM theory.

Your translation is already accurate and well-structured! Here’s a slightly polished version for natural flow and conciseness, while preserving all key details:

---  
The Chinese medical term **"抑郁"** translates to **"depression"** in English.  

**Explanation:**  
- Medically, **"抑郁"** denotes a mental health condition marked by persistent sadness, diminished interest in activities, and accompanying emotional or physical symptoms.  
- Example:  
  - Chinese: 他患有严重的抑郁症。  
  - English: He suffers from severe depression.  

Feel free to ask if you need further clarifications or related terminology!  

---  

### Key Notes:  
1. **"Disorder"** → **"Condition"**: Softens the tone slightly while retaining clinical accuracy.  
2. **"Other symptoms"** → **"Accompanying symptoms"**: Emphasizes the holistic nature of depression.  
3. Removed redundancy (e.g., "In a medical context" → "Medically").  

This version maintains precision while sounding more natural in English. Let me know if you'd like adjustments!

Your translation is already accurate and appropriate for a medical context. Here are the refined versions with additional nuances:  

1. **General/Clinical:**  
   - *"Black stool with blood."*  
   - *"Black, bloody stool."*  

2. **Specialized (GI bleeding):**  
   - *"Melena with blood"* (if confirming upper GI bleeding).  
   - *"Hematochezia with melena"* (if distinguishing lower GI bright red blood + upper GI black stool).  

3. **Layman’s Terms:**  
   - *"Dark black poop mixed with blood."*  

**Note:**  
- *Melena* implies tarry, black stool from digested blood (typically upper GI).  
- If blood is fresh/red, *"hematochezia"* may apply (lower GI).

Here is the English translation of your provided Chinese medical text, maintaining the original structure and terminology:

---

The English translation of the Chinese medical term **"消瘦"** is **"emaciation"** or **"wasting."**  

### **Explanation:**  
- **Emaciation**: Refers to abnormal thinness caused by severe weight loss, often due to illness, malnutrition, or chronic disease.  
- **Wasting**: A related term, frequently used in conditions like **cachexia** (a metabolic disorder seen in cancer or chronic illnesses) or **muscle wasting**.  

### **Example Usage:**  
- *"The patient presented with progressive emaciation due to untreated hyperthyroidism."*  
- *"Chronic tuberculosis can lead to severe wasting."*  

Let me know if you need further clarification or context!  

---

### **Key Notes:**  
1. **"消瘦"** is most precisely translated as **"emaciation"** in clinical contexts, while **"wasting"** is often used for muscle or tissue loss.  
2. **Cachexia** (恶病质) is a specific medical term for severe wasting associated with chronic diseases.

The Chinese text "要利琴" does not appear to be a standard medical term or phrase. It could potentially be a name or a typographical error.  

If you meant a specific medical term or phrase, please provide more context or verify the correct characters. For example:  
- If you meant "利胆" (lì dǎn), it translates to "choleretic" (promoting bile production).  
- If you meant "要利胆" (yào lì dǎn), it could mean "choleretic drug/medicine."  

Let me know if you'd like clarification or a different translation!  

*(Note: The English translation remains the same as the original text is already in English. If you intended to provide a Chinese phrase for translation, please share the correct term.)*

Your translation and explanation are already accurate and clear. Here’s a polished version for conciseness and natural flow in English:  

---  
**Translation:**  
"慢性腹痛" translates to **"chronic abdominal pain"** in English.  

### Explanation:  
- **慢性 (chronic)**: Indicates a persistent or recurrent condition.  
- **腹痛 (abdominal pain)**: Discomfort localized in the abdomen.  

This medical term describes abdominal pain lasting weeks to months or longer, often associated with conditions such as *irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gastritis*, or *inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)*.  

Let me know if you need further clarification or additional context!  

---  
### Key Notes:  
1. **"Long-lasting"** can be omitted since *"chronic"* inherently conveys duration.  
2. **"Discomfort"** is sometimes used alongside *"pain"* to account for milder symptoms (e.g., in IBS).  
3. **Formatting**: Italics for disease names align with medical writing conventions.  

Would you like any adjustments for a specific audience (e.g., patients vs. clinicians)?

Here is the English translation of the Chinese medical term **"停经"**:  

The English translation for **"停经"** is **"cessation of menstruation"** or **"amenorrhea."**  

- **Cessation of menstruation** refers to the stopping of menstrual periods, which can occur naturally (e.g., menopause) or due to other factors (e.g., pregnancy, hormonal imbalances).  
- **Amenorrhea** is the medical term for the absence of menstruation, classified as:  
  - **Primary amenorrhea** (when a woman has never menstruated by age 15).  
  - **Secondary amenorrhea** (when previously regular periods stop for at least 3 months).

Your translation and explanation are already quite accurate and clear! Here’s a slightly refined version for natural flow in medical English while preserving the original meaning:

### English Translation:  
**"wandering gas-like abdominal mass"**  

### Explanation:  
- **腹部 (abdominal)**: Pertaining to the abdomen.  
- **气串样 (wandering/gas-like migratory)**: Describes a mass that moves or shifts unpredictably, akin to the sensation of gas traversing the intestines. This is often linked to conditions such as **intestinal obstruction, functional gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., IBS), or trapped gas**.  
- **肿块 (mass)**: A palpable lump or swelling.  

### Clinical Context:  
This term is frequently used in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)** to characterize masses that are non-fixed, fluctuant, and associated with *qi stagnation* or *functional dysmotility*. In Western medicine, it may correlate with:  
- **Functional bloating** (e.g., IBS-related)  
- **Partial bowel obstruction** (e.g., due to adhesions)  
- **Reducible hernias** (where the mass temporarily disappears upon manipulation)  

### Additional Notes:  
- **"Wandering"** emphasizes the migratory nature, while **"gas-like"** highlights the resemblance to gaseous distension.  
- In TCM, such masses are often attributed to **"qi stagnation" (气滞)** and treated with therapies to regulate qi flow (e.g., acupuncture, herbal formulas like *Chai Hu Shu Gan San*).

**Chinese Term:** 幻觉 (huànjué)  
**English Translation:** Hallucination  

**Definition:**  
A hallucination is a false perception occurring without an external stimulus, yet it feels vividly real. It can affect any sensory domain (e.g., sight, hearing, smell, touch) and is commonly linked to psychiatric conditions (such as schizophrenia), neurological disorders, substance abuse, or sensory deprivation.  

**Clinical Example:**  
"Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia frequently report auditory hallucinations, including hearing non-existent voices."

Here is the English translation of your provided Chinese medical text:  

---  

The English translation of the Chinese medical term **"腹胀"** is **"abdominal distension"** or **"bloating"**.  

### Explanation:  
- **Abdominal distension** refers to a feeling of fullness or swelling in the abdomen, often caused by gas, fluid retention, or digestive disorders.  
- **Bloating** is a broader term describing discomfort due to excess gas or digestive disturbances.  

In medical contexts, **"abdominal distension"** is the more formal clinical term, while **"bloating"** is frequently used in everyday speech.

Your translation is already accurate and clear! Here’s a slightly refined version for conciseness and natural flow in medical contexts:  

---  
**"Irregular vaginal bleeding"**  

This refers to abnormal vaginal bleeding occurring outside the regular menstrual cycle. Potential causes include hormonal imbalances, infections, or other gynecological disorders.  

*Let me know if you need further elaboration or specific adaptations (e.g., for patient education vs. clinical reports).*  

---  

### Key Notes:  
1. **"Unexpected"** was omitted as "abnormal" suffices in medical terminology.  
2. **"Conditions" → "Disorders"**: Slightly more precise for pathological contexts.  
3. Simplified phrasing while retaining all critical information.

Here is the English translation of your Chinese medical text:  

---  

The English translation of "异性装扮癖" is **"transvestism"** or **"cross-dressing."**  

### Explanation:  
- **Transvestism** refers to the practice of wearing clothing typically associated with the opposite gender, often for emotional or psychological satisfaction.  
- **Cross-dressing** is a more neutral, modern term describing the same behavior without necessarily implying a medical or pathological context.  

In clinical settings (e.g., DSM-5), the term may be linked to **"transvestic disorder"** if it causes significant distress or impairment. However, casual cross-dressing is not considered a disorder.  

Let me know if you need further clarification!
