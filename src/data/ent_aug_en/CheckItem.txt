Here is the English translation of your provided Chinese medical text:  

---  

**Translation:**  
The English translation of "CT检查" is "CT scan" or "Computed Tomography scan."  

**Explanation:**  
- "CT" stands for "Computed Tomography," a medical imaging technique that uses X-rays to create detailed cross-sectional images of the body.  
- "检查" translates to "examination" or "scan" in this context.  

Thus, "CT检查" is commonly rendered as "CT scan" in English medical terminology.  

**Example usage:**  
- "医生建议他做一个CT检查。" → "The doctor recommended that he get a CT scan."

Your translation is already accurate and clear! Here’s a slightly refined version for conciseness and natural flow in English:

**"Six-Item Blood Biochemistry Panel"**  

This standard blood test measures six key biochemical markers, commonly including:  
- **Glucose**  
- **Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)**  
- **Creatinine**  
- **Total Cholesterol**  
- **Triglycerides**  
- **Liver Enzymes (ALT/AST)**  

*(Note: Specific components may vary by institution or region.)*  

---  

### Key Adjustments:  
1. **"Panel"** sounds more natural than "Test" in clinical contexts for grouped assays.  
2. **"Blood Urea Nitrogen"** is the full term (abbreviated as BUN in parentheses).  
3. Simplified phrasing for readability (e.g., "measures six key markers" vs. "performed on a blood sample").

Your translation is already accurate and clear! Here’s a slightly refined version for natural flow and completeness:  

---  
**"Gynecological Ultrasound Examination"**  

This refers to an ultrasound scan specifically designed to assess the female reproductive system, including the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, and adjacent structures. It is widely used to diagnose conditions like fibroids, ovarian cysts, ectopic pregnancies, or to monitor fetal development during pregnancy.  

The examination may be performed transabdominally (over the pelvis) or transvaginally (with a probe inserted into the vagina) for higher-resolution imaging, depending on clinical needs.  

Let me know if you'd like further elaboration on specific aspects!  

---  
**Key Notes:**  
1. Added **"adjacent structures"** for anatomical inclusivity.  
2. Expanded examples (**"ectopic pregnancies"**) and clarified pregnancy monitoring (**"fetal development"**).  
3. Included **methods (transabdominal/transvaginal)** for context.  

Would you like to emphasize any particular clinical applications or procedural details?

**English Translation of "性激素六项检查":**  
**"Six Sex Hormone Tests"** or **"Sex Hormone Panel (Six Items)"**  

This panel typically measures the following six hormones:  
1. **Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)**  
2. **Luteinizing Hormone (LH)**  
3. **Estradiol (E2)**  
4. **Progesterone (P)**  
5. **Testosterone (T)**  
6. **Prolactin (PRL)**  

It is widely used to evaluate reproductive health, fertility concerns, menstrual irregularities, and endocrine disorders.  

Let me know if you'd like further elaboration!  

---  

### Key Adjustments:  
- **"Assess" → "Evaluate"**: Slightly more clinical tone.  
- **"Issues" → "Concerns"**: Softer and more patient-friendly.  
- **"Disorders" → "Irregularities"** (for menstrual): Avoids overmedicalizing unless context requires.  
- **"Conditions" → "Disorders"** (for endocrine): More precise for pathology.

Here’s the English translation of your medical text:  

---  

**纤维结肠镜检查** is translated as **"fiberoptic colonoscopy."**  

This term refers to a medical procedure that uses a flexible, fiberoptic endoscope to examine the interior of the colon for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.  

**Alternative translations include:**  
- **Colonoscopy** (a general term, though it does not specify the use of fiberoptic technology)  
- **Fiber-optic colonoscopy** (less common but technically accurate)  

Let me know if you need further clarification or additional context!

**English Translation of "粪中细胞":**  
- **"Cells in feces"** (literal)  
- **"Fecal cells"** (common term in medical literature)  
- **"Cells in stool"** (clinical alternative)  

*Example Usage:*  
- "Microscopic examination revealed abnormal **fecal cells**."  
- "The presence of **cells in stool** may indicate gastrointestinal pathology."  

Let me know if you need adjustments for a specific context (e.g., lab reports, research papers).  

---  
**Key Notes:**  
1. **"Fecal cells"** is concise and widely used in scientific writing.  
2. **"Stool"** is often preferred in patient-facing or clinical reports (less technical than "feces").  
3. For precision, specify cell types if applicable (e.g., *"white blood cells in feces"* → **"fecal leukocytes"**).  

Would you like to add any technical details (e.g., cell origin or diagnostic relevance)?

**"Occult Blood Test"**  

This test detects hidden (occult) blood in stool, urine, or other bodily fluids that is not visible to the naked eye. It is commonly used to screen for conditions such as gastrointestinal bleeding, colorectal cancer, or urinary tract disorders.  

Let me know if you need further details!

### Key Notes:  
1. **"匿血试验"** → **"Occult Blood Test"** (standard medical term).  
2. **"hidden blood"** is clarified with **(occult)** in parentheses for precision.  
3. **"conditions like..."** → **"conditions such as..."** (more formal/academic phrasing).  
4. **"urinary tract issues"** → **"urinary tract disorders"** (medical preference for "disorders" over "issues").

Here is the English translation of your provided Chinese medical text:  

---  

**"Routine urinalysis"** or **"urine routine test"** is the English translation of **"尿常规"**.  

This refers to a standard diagnostic test that evaluates the visual, chemical, and microscopic characteristics of a urine sample. It is used to assess overall health, screen for metabolic disorders, or diagnose conditions such as **urinary tract infections (UTIs), kidney disease, or diabetes**. Common parameters analyzed include **color, clarity, pH, specific gravity, protein, glucose, ketones, blood cells, and bacteria**.  

In clinical settings, alternative terms may include **"urine test"** or the abbreviation **"UA" (urinalysis)**.

Your translation is already accurate and clear! Here’s a slightly refined version for conciseness and natural flow:  

---  
**"Blood Electrolyte Test"**  

This is a laboratory test that measures levels of key electrolytes (e.g., sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate) in the blood. It helps evaluate metabolic and kidney function, hydration status, and other health conditions.  

Let me know if you'd like further details!  

---  
### Key Notes:  
1. **Simplified phrasing**: "Refers to" → "This is" for directness.  
2. **Examples**: "Such as" → "e.g.," (standard in medical texts).  
3. **Conciseness**: Combined "assess" and "evaluate" into one verb.  

This maintains precision while sounding more natural in English medical contexts. Would you like any adjustments for a specific audience (e.g., patients vs. professionals)?

Here’s the English translation of your Chinese medical text:  

**"无痛肠镜"** translates to **"painless colonoscopy"** in English.  

This term describes a colonoscopy procedure conducted under sedation or anesthesia to reduce or eliminate discomfort for the patient. Alternative medical terms include:  
- **"Sedated colonoscopy"** (when conscious sedation is applied)  
- **"Anesthesia-assisted colonoscopy"** (if deeper sedation or general anesthesia is used).  

Feel free to ask if you need further clarification or additional information!

The English translation of **"造影检查"** is **"contrast imaging examination"** or **"contrast-enhanced imaging study."**  

### **Explanation:**  
- **造影 (contrast)** refers to the use of a contrast agent (dye or radiopharmaceutical) to enhance the visibility of internal structures in medical imaging.  
- **检查 (examination/study)** refers to a diagnostic imaging procedure.  

### **Common Types:**  
- **CT造影检查 (CT contrast scan)**  
- **MRI造影检查 (MRI contrast imaging)**  
- **血管造影 (angiography)**  

This term is widely used in radiology for procedures such as X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs where contrast agents are administered to improve image clarity.  

---  

### **Additional Notes:**  
- **"Contrast imaging"** is a general term, while **"contrast-enhanced imaging"** emphasizes the use of a contrast agent.  
- **"Angiography"** specifically refers to blood vessel imaging using contrast.

The English translation of "免疫电泳" is **"immunoelectrophoresis"**.  

### Explanation:  
- **免疫 (immuno-)** refers to the immune system or immunological reactions.  
- **电泳 (electrophoresis)** is a laboratory technique used to separate molecules (such as proteins) based on their size and charge under an electric field.  

**Immunoelectrophoresis** combines electrophoresis with immunodiffusion to analyze antigen-antibody interactions, commonly used in clinical diagnostics (e.g., detecting abnormal proteins like in multiple myeloma).

**English Translation of "粪便显微镜检查":**  
**"Stool Microscopic Examination"**  

Other common equivalents include:  
- **"Fecal Microscopy"**  
- **"Microscopic Examination of Stool"**  

This diagnostic procedure involves examining a stool sample under a microscope to identify abnormalities, such as:  
- Parasites (e.g., ova, cysts)  
- Pathogenic bacteria  
- Blood cells (e.g., erythrocytes, leukocytes)  
- Undigested food particles  
- Other pathological components.  

Let me know if you'd like additional details or context!  

---  

### Key Notes:  
1. **"Fecal" vs. "Stool"**: Both are correct, but "stool" is more patient-friendly, while "fecal" is often used in clinical/lab settings.  
2. **Clarity**: Explicitly listing common findings (e.g., parasites, blood cells) enhances practical understanding.  
3. **Formality**: The phrasing aligns with standard medical reports or patient education materials.

Here’s the English translation of your Chinese medical text:  

---  

The English translation of "骨密度测定" is **"bone density measurement"** or **"bone mineral density (BMD) test."**  

This term refers to a medical procedure used to assess the strength and density of bones, commonly performed to diagnose conditions like osteoporosis or evaluate fracture risk. Common methods include DXA (Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) scans.  

Let me know if you'd like additional context or variations!
